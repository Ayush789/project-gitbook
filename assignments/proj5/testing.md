# Testing

We strongly encourage writing more tests than given, as the given tests for this project are not comprehensive tests: it is possible to write incorrect code that passes them all \(but not get full score\).

You may use the given test cases as starting points to create your own tests.

Note that there are some helper methods defined for testing at the bottom of the test file, which may be helpful \(or crucial\) for writing tests. We suggest also looking at the `TestRecoveryManager.java` file for an example of how to write tests with these helper methods.
