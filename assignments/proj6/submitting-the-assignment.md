# Submitting the Assignment

### Files

You should make sure that all code you modify belongs to the .js files inside the `query/` directory.

### Gradescope

Once all of your files are prepared in your repo you can submit to Gradescope through GitHub the same way you did for [Project 0](https://cs186.gitbook.io/project/assignments/proj0/submitting#pushing-changes-to-github-classroom).

### Grading

* This project will be worth 6% of your overall grade in the class. 100% of your grade will come from the public tests provided to you.
