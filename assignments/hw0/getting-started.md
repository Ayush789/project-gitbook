# Getting Started

## Logistics

This homework is due Thursday, 9/3/2020 at 11:59PM PDT (GMT-7). It is worth 0% of your overall grade, but failure to complete it may result in being administratively dropped from the class.

## Prerequisites

No lectures are required to work through this homework.

## `git` and GitHub

[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a _version control_ system, that helps developers like you track different versions of your code, synchronize them across different machines, and collaborate with others. If you don't already have git on your machine you can follow the instructions [here ](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)to install it.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a site which supports this system, hosting it as a service.

We will be using git and GitHub to pass out homework assignments in this course. If you don't know much about git, that isn't a problem: you will _need_ to use it only in very simple ways that we will show you in order to keep up with class assignments.

If you'd like to use git for managing your own code versioning, there are many guides to using git online -- [this](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started) is a good one.

## Fetching the released code

All assignments in CS 186 will be passed out via GitHub. Please check Piazza to keep up-to-date on changes to assignments.

You should now follow the instructions in the [Fetching the released code section of the MOOCbase README](README.md#fetching-the-released-code) to get the skeleton code for MOOCbase, which most of the projects will be building on \(Project 1 is the sole exception -- it is on SQL, and will not be using the same repo, but this homework and all the remaining projects after will involve writing Java to add functionality to MOOCbase\).

Once you have a copy of the released code, head to the next section "Your Tasks" and begin working on the assignment.
