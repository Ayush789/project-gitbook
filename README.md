Moocbase is a bare-bones database implementation which supports executing simple transactions in series. In the assignments of this class, you will be adding to this implementation, adding support for B+ tree indices, efficient join algorithms, query optimization, multigranularity locking to support concurrent execution of transactions, and database recovery.

As you will be working with this codebase for the rest of the semester, it is a good idea to get familiar with it.
